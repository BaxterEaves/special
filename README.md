# Special Functions

The library provides [special functions][1] and currently includes:

* `erf` — the error function,
* `erfc` — the complementary error function,
* `exp` — the exponential function,
* `lbeta` — the natural logarithm of the beta function,
* `lgamma` — the natural logarithm of the gamma function, and
* `log` — the natural logarithm.

## Acknowledgments

The library is based on [libm][2].
